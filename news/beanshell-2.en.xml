 <title>Beanshell 2.0</title>

 <p>Beanshell is a Java interpreter, very handy to test pieces of code
  and write scripts able to make use of the huge API of this
  language. This latest version (still in beta) is now able to
  interpret all Java source files, even those defining classes (which
  was not possible using previous versions). A good news!</p>
